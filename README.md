# AutonomousVehicle
   The project, which I generally define as an Autonomous Vehicle, basically works according to the communication algorithm between the vehicle and the camera.
   For robots to go from one place to another, they must follow a certain path, that is, they must proceed on their own route. He has to recognize the obstacles in the environment and determine his path accordingly.

   This is Similation of Project
